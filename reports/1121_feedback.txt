Looks like good progress. It would be nice if your report made it easier for me to understand your progress on each deliverable at a glance.
In terms of the original MS1 goals: 
 - refraction is working on spheres; does it also work on meshes?
 - edge detection is working, but a softer edge map is desired
 - global and edge-aware anti-aliasing is working (this was a MS2 goal)
 - area lights are not implemented yet

In future reports please also include instructions for running your code (ideally with test scenes that showcase your results, such as the ones in the renders in your report).

Looking forward to seeing your MS2 results.
