Project Proposal Resubmission
Josh
Edge detection
As traceray iterates, cache n most recent object ids. Check arr[1] and arr[length] for different object ids.
Oren-Nayar Diffuse Reflection model
Another material object
Example scene comparing this against Lambertian shading (rough texture object)

Jackson
Area lights. Rectangular object. Sample using 3 different methods: uniform, random, stratified.  Take samples from some number of rectangular subdivisions of the area light to approximate a light of nonzero area.
Antialiasing– average rays across sub pixels to “fake” a higher quality resolution.
Shahu
Refraction– Each object in the scene will have reflection and refraction parameters. At a ray intersection, calculate the reflected ray and the refracted ray. Shoot those rays into the scene using traceray. Remember to set a maximum recursion depth. 
Bounding volume hierarchy

Milestone 1 Goals
Josh
Edge detection
Jackson
Area light object. All 3 sampling methods
Shahu
Refraction coeff for all scene object
Written implementation plan for bounding volume hierarchy
Milestone 2 Goals
Milestone 2 goals will be revised upon completion of Milestone 1. For now, these are our goals.
